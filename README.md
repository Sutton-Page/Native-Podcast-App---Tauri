# Project Description
For a while now I have wanted to build a native Windows application. I have tried multiple different frameworks and this project is the result of me experimenting with the Tauri framework: https://v2.tauri.app/.
To keep it simple I decided to create an application for searching for, listening to, and downloading podcasts using RSS feeds. 

## Project Architecture
Frontend was created using Svelte framework while the backends for the project is written in Rust.\
