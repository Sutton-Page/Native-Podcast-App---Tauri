# Project Description
To experiment with the different ways to make a native Windows Application. As an experiment I decided to try to build a simple windows application using the framework Tauri https://v2.tauri.app/. To keep it simple I decided to create an application for searching for, listening to, and downloading podcasts using RSS feeds.
