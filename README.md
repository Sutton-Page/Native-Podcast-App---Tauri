# Project Description
As an experiment I decided to try to build a simple Windows application using the framework Tauri: https://v2.tauri.app/. To keep it simple I decided to create an application for searching for, listening to, and downloading podcasts using RSS feeds. 

## Project Architecture
Frontend was created using Svelte framework while the backends for the project is written in Rust.
